Image classification using TensorFlow and TFLite to bring the model to Android

Model was trained via Transfer Learning. Its foundation is the convolutional part of the MobileNetV2 model.
The classifier part of the neural network was trained from scratch to recognize 51 classes of animals.

The code for the model can be found [here](https://github.com/tomislavrekic/TransferLearning)

Pictures taken using the camera are used as the model's input. There is also a database which stores information about these pictures.
